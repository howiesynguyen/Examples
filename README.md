# Demonstration code/Examples

This repository (https://github.com/howiesynguyen/Java-basedExamples) contains mostly Java-based demonstration code/examples. It should be used as a reference for learning purposes. The design and implementation are kept simple as much as possible. The examples ignore some concerns such as unit testing, error handling, logging, and etcâ€¦ It may not be a good practice, but hopefully it could give you some ideas
