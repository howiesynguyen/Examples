# Demonstration code/Examples

This repository (https://github.com/howiesynguyen/Java-basedExamples) contains mostly Java-based demonstration code/examples. It should be used as a reference for learning purposes. The design and implementation are kept simple as much as possible. The examples may ignore some concerns such as unit testing, error handling, logging, and etcâ€¦ It may not be a good practice, but hopefully it could give you some ideas

**DemoSpringHypermediaDrivenRESTAPI**:
An example of how to use Spring HATEOAS to create a hypermedia-driven RESTAPI - a simple backend service that can be used to manage a list of owners and their pets. 

**DemoSpringOAuth2MultiClientRegs**

**DemoSpringOauth2LoginWithAnOIDCProvider**

**DemoSpringBootWebFluxHelloWorld**

**DemoSpringBootWebFluxOAuth2Login**

**DemoSpringReactiveMongo**

**DemoVertxHelloWorldVerticle**

**DemoVertx4FunFrontendService**,
**DemoVertx4FunRandomNumberService**,
**DemoVertx4FunSaySomethingService**

**DemoSpringStreamWithJavaFuntions** This example shows you how to use Spring Cloud Stream with Java Functions in favor of functional programming. "Spring Cloud Stream is a framework for building highly scalable event-driven microservices connected with shared messaging systems" (spring.io).

**DockerContainerizedKafka4Dev** An Apache Kafka setup using Docker for development purposes

**DemoJsonHttpServer** An example of using the following

- HttpServer (JDK)
- JSON In Java (JSON.org)
- Apache HttpClient
 
The example provides a simple calculator via an HTTP server that accepts JSON requests via the URL http://localhost:8081/calculator </br>
for example, HTTP POST: {"operator":"SUBTRACTION", "a":1, "b":2} </br>
and then return a JSON response, for example {"result":3.0, "operator":"SUBTRACTION", "a":1.0, "b":2.0}

Try executing JUnit Test class CalculatorTest to see how to run it
